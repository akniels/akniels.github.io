# Registry

We have been blessed to have a lot of the "essential" home items a newly engaged couple needs. We hope you find this registry as a way to help us make our perfect honeymoon come true! While we have taken many exciting trips together, we are very much looking forward to our first real adventure as husband and wife. It is because of the lifetime of memories we will gain from this trip that we finally settled on a honeymoon registry. We greatly appreciate and will fondly remember these gifts for years to come. After all, the memories from this honeymoon will last a lot longer than a new set of dishes (especially at our breakage rate!).
